      <h2>Career</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>IWD</h3>
        <h4>CTO & Board member (2006-2021)</h4>

        <a href="https://bit.ly/3Ii44pK">IWD</a> provides a SaaS platform that
        allows <a href="https://bit.ly/3Ifa3M3">clients</a> to manage their
        merchandising and in-store execution. <br /><br />

        “I wanted to start a project from scratch. I got the chance to meet
        Nicolas & Gabriel in a garage, true story, where they showed me the POC
        they already sold to Shiseido. They were looking for their future CTO to
        build it as a SaaS. I had no experience as CTO but I guess my arguments
        worked and that was the beginning of a long journey! Everybody asks me
        why I stay that long? Well the company was changing every 3-4 years in
        terms of size, products, practices… it was like a new one and I was
        growing with it”

        <strong>Opensource</strong><br />
        <a href="https://github.com/RETFU/RREST">RREST</a> was a library to
        enforce REST best practice and improve developer xp by managing most of
        the i/o. <br />
        It allowed the developer to focus on business code and not plumbery, you
        just needed to define the contract via an API Spec (RAML, OpenAPI) and
        create the controller. That’s it.<br />
        We used it internally to build the early stage of our API and then we
        internalized the development.<br />
        My initial idea was to support this project but I already had enough on
        my plate!
